Currently, NextAuth.js relies on the community to provide TypeScript types. You can download it from [DefinitelyTyped](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/next-auth).

Add it to your project with:

```sh
npm i -D @types/next-auth
```

or

```sh
yarn add -D @types/next-auth
```

You can find an initial Pull Request at [next-auth#516](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/pull/516) adding TypeScript. At the time of this writing, it looks like we would like to go from a complete migration to a more relaxed, incremental rewrite.

Feel free to open a Pull Request, if you would like to contribute!
